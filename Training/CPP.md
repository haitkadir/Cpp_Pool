# CPP PooL

### After spending about 8 month in learnign and building projects using `C`,
### now it's time to switch a little bit so the nearest one is `C++`.


- Today I leant simple `C++` syntax and created my first `C++` program,
- that usual one you know, `Hello world` program

```c++

#include <iostream>

int main(){
    std::cout << "Hello world!";
}

```
- Now let's discuss the above program and explain all this new things
- `#include <iostream>` This how we included this header file that has `std`.
- `int main()` It called main function which is the entre point of the program,
- means all your functions should be called inside this function.
- `cout` Is a standerd output.
- `<<` Think of these left arows as a function like that `cout.print("hello world")`.

#### That's all
